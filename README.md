# Jekyll TailwindCSS Starter Kit
An opinionated starter project using Jekyll and TailwindCSS that supports Just-in-Time Mode (JIT).

Since JIT was added to TailwindCSS, getting it to work with PostCSS has been a struggle and there is currently an open issue on the PostCSS page. Instead of waiting, I created an alternative setup using TailwindCSS CLI for building and watching CSS files, BrowserSync for serving and browser reloading, and Jekyll only for static page building. It works great.

## Installation
(https://browsersync.io)[BrowserSync]
TailwindCSS
Jekyll

Yarn install. Bundle install.

## Usage

Yarn watch. Yarn build.
